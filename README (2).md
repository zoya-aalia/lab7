# COSC 304 - Introduction to Database Systems<br>Lab 8: Images, Security, and Transactions

Modify your existing project web site with new features including a product detail page, a login feature, an administrator page, and support for transactions.

## Project Requirements (25 marks)

1. [Sample web site](https://cosc304.ok.ubc.ca/rlawrenc/tomcat/lab8/index.jsp)

2. Start with the setup for lab 7 for either [Java](https://github.com/rlawrenc/cosc_304/blob/master/labs/lab7/java/assign/setup), [PHP](https://github.com/rlawrenc/cosc_304/blob/master/labs/lab7/php/assign/setup), or [Node.js](https://github.com/rlawrenc/cosc_304/blob/master/labs/lab7/nodejs/assign/setup). **If you have an existing Docker container for lab 7, you do not need to download and setup lab 7 again.**

3. Download starter code for [Java](304_lab8_java.zip), [PHP](304_lab8_php.zip), or [Node.js](304_lab8_starter_node.zip). These code files should be **ADDED** to your existing lab 7 project. There is a new main page (`index.jsp/php`), an administrator page (`admin.jsp/php`), and images in the `img` folder. The four new code files to change: `validateLogin.jsp/php`, `product.jsp/php`, `admin.jsp/php`, and `ship.jsp/php`.

4. Your output does not have to look exactly like the sample (feel free to make it look better!).

The product page will show details on the product including images. An image can be retrieved from a local folder using a URL or stored as a binary object in the database.
