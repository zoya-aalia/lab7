# COSC 304 - Introduction to Database Systems<br>Lab 7: Building a Database-enabled Web Site using JSP

**Please follow the setup instructions located in the [assign/setup](assign/setup) directory.**

**The sample code for these examples is [code/304_lab7_example_java.zip](code/304_lab7_example_java.zip).**

**Edit the sample code in the folder `WebContent`.**

## Example 1

Here is the code to show "Hello World!" using JSP:

```
<html>
<head>
<title>Hello World in JSP</title>
</head>
<body>

<% out.println("Hello World!"); %>

</body>
</html>
```

[Click for a demonstration of the Hello World code](https://cosc304.ok.ubc.ca/rlawrenc/tomcat/Lab7/HelloWorld.jsp)

The URL of the JSP file is: `http://localhost/shop/HelloWorld.jsp`

Modify the code using a text editor. Try and change the code so that the output looks like this:

# Hello World Again!

<pre>
1
2
3
4
5
</pre>

### [Solution - HelloWorldAgain.jsp](code/HelloWorldAgain.jsp)

## Example 2

[Example code](code/JdbcQuery.jsp) to query the workson database and return some answers in a table.  Make sure that the url is `jdbc:mysql://cosc304_mysql/workson` and put in your user id and password. Note the URL is not `localhost` as the JSP file is running in a container that does not contain the MySQL database server.

## Example 3

Modify the sample JSP code for querying WorksOn such that for each department you list its projects and then its employees.  The output should look like <a href="https://cosc304.ok.ubc.ca/rlawrenc/tomcat/Lab7/WorksOnDeptEmpProj.jsp">this (click here)</a>.

### [Solution - WorksOnDeptEmpProj.jsp](code/WorksOnDeptEmpProj.jsp)


## Example 4

You can pass and receive parameters between JSP pages.  An example is to create an HTML form that collects user input and then passes this information to a JSP file to perform the query and return the answers.

### [Query Form Example](code/QueryJSP.html)

### [JSP Code for Performing Query](code/EmpQuery.jsp)


## Example 5

Create your own query form for the WorksOn database. Your form should have boxes for the Employee name and Project name that accept partial matches (using `LIKE '%queryString%'`).  The JSP file should receive the parameters and create a query that lists all WorksOn records where the employee name and project name are as specified.  Show the count of the # of records at the bottom of the page.  An [example query form and system](https://cosc304.ok.ubc.ca/rlawrenc/tomcat/Lab7/WorksOnQuery.html) is available.
